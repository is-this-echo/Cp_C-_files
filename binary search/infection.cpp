/* 
Amongst n number of people in a park. One of them has a virus. 
Let's assume all the folks are standing in an x-axis line. The positions of people are given as input.
 A contaminated person can spread the virus up to d distance. Find the minimum and maximum spread 
 of the virus that could occur.
Input: n = 5, d = 5, [1,3,5,9,14]
Output: [1, 3]
minimum spread = 1 by 14, maximum spread = 3 by 5
I have solved that problem using the Binary Search Method with O(NlogN) 
Time Complexity & O(1) Space Complexity.
