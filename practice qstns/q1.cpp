 /*Given an array of integers, arr and a value k.
 We can perform an operation on the array in which we can delete three consecutive elements, 
 say arr[i], arr[i+1], arr[i+2] of the array. We can do this operation only if 
 arr[i+2]-arr[i+1]=arr[i+1]-arr[i]=k. 
 Find the minimum possible length of the array by doing this operation as many times as you wish. 
 For example arr = [6, 8, 10, 12, 8, 10]. 
 We can firstly delete the subarray [8, 10, 12] to obtain arr = [6, 8, 10],
  then we can delete the whole array [6, 8, 10] to obtain an array of  length 0. 
  So the answer will be 0.
